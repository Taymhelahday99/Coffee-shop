                    <p class='typebody'>An Americano is a classic espresso-style drink with a smooth and well-rounded flavor.

                        hot water at a 1:3 to 1:4 ratio, resulting in a drink that retains the complex flavors
                        of espresso, but in a lighter way </p>
